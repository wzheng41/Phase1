Description
This project collected 66 coordinate files that the robot imitated human behavior changed over time. From the coordinates, we can determine which actions have similar coordinates. In this project, we successively used normalizes and Gaussian formulas to normalize the data, and then used TF-IDF to find the parameters of the corresponding data to facilitate future use of the parameters to study, and then we converted these processed parameters into Gray scale The heat map visualizes the data more, and finally selects 10 most similar gestures by comparing all the file data. Assuming that without the support of these steps and theories, it is difficult to see similar values for unprocessed data. This is the importance of processing data, and the difference between each data can be seen more intuitively.

Test
(1)Task 1 will show 1-60.wrd.csv and test1-test6.wrd.csv ar output floder
(2)Task 2 will show the vectors.txt at output floder
(3)Task 3 will show the test1-test6.png at Task3Output
(4)Task 4 will show the 10 most similar files.
